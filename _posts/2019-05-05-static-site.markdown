| Framework           | Language | Description |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| [Jekyll][jekyll]    | Ruby     |Available as a Gem or integrated with GitHub Pages. Jekyll is fast and efficient but offers minimal features out of the box. Many plugins are offering additional functionalities. |
| [Gatsby][gatsby]    | React    | Along with Jekyll, Gatsby is the most popular static website framework. It offers very good performance and a large range of plugin as well as integrations with many third-party services. |
| [Hugo][hugo]        | Go       | Hugo puts forward its impressive performance, especially while building large websites. It offers anything you need to build a website compliant with SEO best practices out of the box. |
| [Hexo][hexo]        | NodeJS   | Another fast static website generator with a built-in package manager to install plugins and themes. |
| [Pelican][pelican]  | Python   | Pelican is another interesting alternative for pythonistas however it doesn’t have as many much third-party resources available (themes, plugins…) as the previous ones. |
